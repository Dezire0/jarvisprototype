# Security Model

## What We Will Support

- user-approved desktop automation
- app launching and browser navigation
- reading the active screen with permission
- using existing logged-in browser sessions
- using the OS password manager or browser autofill where the user already approved it
- storing automation credentials only when the user explicitly saves them
- keeping credential metadata in `~/.friday-jarvis/credentials.json` and passwords in the OS keychain when available

## What We Will Not Do

- store raw website passwords in the assistant
- silently scrape credentials out of browsers
- claim unrestricted administrator control over the whole machine by default
- perform destructive or sensitive actions without clear user confirmation

## Shared Credential Model

- Electron and Python use the same normalized site key, for example `github.com`.
- Login metadata such as username and login URL is stored in `~/.friday-jarvis/credentials.json`.
- Passwords are stored in the OS keychain on macOS when available.
- Older Electron-only credential files are treated as migration input, not the long-term source of truth.

## Safe Alternative to "Auto Login Everywhere"

For websites and apps, the right pattern is:

1. Reuse the user's existing authenticated session when possible.
2. If a site needs login, open the real login page.
3. Let the browser or OS password manager fill credentials if the user already saved them, or use the assistant's shared secure local vault if the user explicitly entered them there.
4. For services with APIs, use OAuth or app-specific tokens instead of raw passwords.

This gives a Jarvis-like experience without turning the assistant into a credential harvester.

## Privilege Tiers

### Tier 1: Default

- chat
- voice
- open apps
- open URLs
- read visible UI state

### Tier 2: Trusted Automation

- controlled browser automation
- file access in approved folders
- screen OCR
- structured integrations like OBS

### Tier 3: Sensitive

- sending messages
- editing important files
- executing shell commands
- changing account settings

Tier 3 actions should require explicit confirmation and logging.
